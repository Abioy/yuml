# yuml

This is an unofficial command line client for the [yUML](http://yuml.me) web
app. Use it to draw class diagrams, activity diagrams and usecase diagrams
from the command line, integrate yUML into your documentation workflow or what
have you.

`yuml` (the tool) supports all the styles and formats that yUML (the service)
does, so you can take your pick between *scruffy* (the default), *boring* and
*plain* for the styles and *png*, *pdf* or *jpg* for the format.

Have fun.
